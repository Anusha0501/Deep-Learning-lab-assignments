MNIST - Handwritten Digits Image Classification with an MLP using Keras

-----------------
Problem Statement
-----------------
Implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Your solution should load and preprocess the MNIST data, build an MLP with at least one hidden layer, train the model, and evaluate its performance on the test set. 

Submit your well-commented code and a brief summary of your results (ipython notebook).

Problem-1: MLP to solve a Binary Classification problem
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build and train a MLP to predict the IRIS flower categories from the feature measures of petal and sepal. Use IRIS dataset. Take only TWO classes and consider the problem as Binary Classification. 

# Perform the experiment by taking Setosa and Versicolor classes.
# Perform feature standardization/normalization
# Perform a train/test split of 70/30.
# Print classification metrics on the test data (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score).
# Print the trained model parameters.

# Run the experiments for multiple epochs and check the effect of more/less training on the final outcome (e.g. model accuracy on test data)


# Redo the experiment by considering Versicolor and Verginica classes.
Check the role of the activation function and the selected thresholds as you change the target labels.

Problem-2: MLP to solve a Multi-class Classification problem
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build and train a MLP to predict the IRIS flower categories from the feature measures of petal and sepal. Use IRIS dataset. Take ALL the classes. 

# Perform feature standardization/normalization
# Perform a train/test split of 70/30.
# Print classification metrics on the test data (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score).
# Print the trained model parameters.

Problem-3 MLP to solve a Regression problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build and train a MLP to predict the "petal length" of IRIS flowers from the other three feature measures (e.g. petal width, length and width of the sepal). 

# Perform feature standardization/normalization
# Perform a train/test split of 70/30.
# Print regression metrics on the test data (R^2 or MSE).
# Print the trained model parameters.

# Run the experiments/training for multiple epochs and check the effect of more/less training on the final outcome (e.g. MSE scores on test data).

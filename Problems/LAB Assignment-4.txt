Solve the multiclass image classification problem using the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
Perform the following analysis:

1. Build a CNN to solve the problem (typical Deep Learning approach that uses a feed-forward MLP at the end of the CNN layers to classify the images).

2. Extract convolutional features and train a conventional machine learning classifier (e.g. SVM or Logistic Regression).
You need to first get the training and test data ready for this experiment. 

3. Compare the performances of the models built in step 1 and 2.
(note that for the sake of comparison, you need to have exactly the same images in the training and test sets).
